# img2collage
So this is a python script I wrote for a personal project that im working on and decided to share it. So far its very bare but does work. The purpose of this is to create a 1-4 image collage so you have a choice of 1, 2, 3 or 4 images in the collage, it only has 4 spaces and if you decide to have less than 4, it will be replaced with BLACKNESS.




## Installation

So to use this, you will need python, pip and the package pillow

```bash
  pip install pillow
  python img2collage.py
```
Its as simple as that.
